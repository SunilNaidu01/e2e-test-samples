# e2e-test-samples
This repo contains sample apps for all the frameowrks and versions supported in Linux web apps.

Each branch contains a specific framework and version.

For each framework and version we have that app deployed in multiple regions. There will be a parent branch like 
'node-16' which will be deployed in default region (EastUS) and child branches for each region like 'node-16/eastuseuap'
